This is a project that I am completing for ITEC 315 (Programming)

This project will focus on web development using HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript.
The pacing of my progress in main will mostly be based on the pace of the class
and what my professor wants at the time. For example, as of 2/14/24, we're only supposed
to use HTML, no CSS.
Other languages will come later to improve the website.
