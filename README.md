This is a project that I am completing for ITEC 315 (Programming)

This project will focus on web development using HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript.
The pacing of my progress in main will mostly be based on the pace of the class
and what my professor wants at the time.

As of the week of 3/24/24, we are just now starting on implementing PHP into our websites.

Other languages will come later to improve the website.
