            <p class="articletxt">On September 27th, 2023, Valve officially released their long awaited sequel/remaster/remake of their 
                most popular game to date, <i>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</i> (CSGO). CSGO initially came out in 
                August of 2012 and was still popular and played professionally up until the servers were changed over to CS2. I think this 
                game is fun but it is hard sometimes.

            </ul>
            <p class="articletxt">Most of these are my favorites because of just how much I have played them. Some of them aren't the most amazing games 
                in the world, but they all have a special place in my heart. Fun fact, GTA 5 the game that I have the most play 
                time in out of any other game (about 1000 hours). <i>Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga</i> was probably my first 
                favorite game, just because the only thing going on in my life was Legos and Star Wars, which made that my favorite.

            <p class="articletxt">These are the most played games right now on Steam.
                Not a lot of surprises here, <i>Baldurs Gate 3</i> won Game of the Year
                at the 2023 Game Awards and is still on top. I'm surprised to see
                 <i>Apex Legends</i> on this list, I just replayed it for the first time the other 
                 day since 2022. Not much has changed from what I played but still a good time. 
                 <i>Grand Theft Auto 5</i> is still going strong on the top charts despite coming out 
                 in 2013. The hype around <i>Grand Theft Auto 6</i> is real. As far as I know, 
                 Rockstar Games is still on track for a 2025 release date. <i>Palworld</i> is the 
                 <i>Pokemon</i>-like game but with guns. Not sure how they have evaded Nintendo's 
                 legal team, but it's impressive. I haven't played the game myself but I 
                 have heard that it is plagued with a lack of late-game content.
