            <p>On September 27th, 2023, Valve officially released their long awaited sequel/remaster/remake of their 
                most popular game to date, Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO). CSGO initially came out in 
                August of 2012 and was still popular and played professionally up until the servers were changed over to CS2. I think this 
                game is fun but it is hard sometimes.
